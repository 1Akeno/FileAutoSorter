# My File Organizer

This is a Python script designed to help you automatically organize files from your Desktop and Downloads folders into categorized subdirectories.

---

## Description

* This script does what the title says: it organizes your files into specific folders.
* For example, an `image.png` file will automatically be moved into an "Images" folder. The script handles various file types including images, documents, videos, and shortcuts, placing them into a dedicated "Sorted_Files" folder on your Desktop.

## Installation

* **Download the executable**: Get the `main.exe`  from the **[Releases page](https://github.com/1Akeno/FileAutoSorter/releases/tag/Main)** of this repository.

## How to Use

1.  **Simply double-click** the `main.exe` file.
2.  The script will run in the background and organize files from your Desktop and Downloads folders. A new folder named `Sorted_Files` will appear on your Desktop containing the organized files.
